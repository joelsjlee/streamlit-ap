Although no articles about the Holocaust followed the Dec 17 announcement, two editorials alluded to it.

(1) Dec. 20, 1942, p.4, 4th paragraph of editorial titled  ‚ÄúIn Darkest Hours.‚Äù  In an effort to express hope for the future, this sad example in a Christian context showed an awareness of ‚Äúpogroms‚Äù but not of the horrific severity and magnitude of what was going on in Europe.
‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúAnd it is by our faith in the certain arrival of that day [when we have light to build on this earth the city of God] -- ‚Ä¶ that there are values above and beyond those of the distracted, troubletorn present, values which no war lord can kill and no pogrom or blood-purge can tarnish‚Äîthat we must get on with the business of living.‚Äù  

(2) Dec 31, 1942, p 4. Editorial titled ‚ÄúRing Out the Old‚Äù includes the line 
 ‚Äú‚Ä¶ millions of helpless men, women, and children have suffered and died under terrifying conditions that beggar description.‚Äù","Anne, it looks like another citizen historian found and uploaded this particular article in the past. The headline is so strikingly understated to me in tone with the use of the word ""folk"" but it could be at the time, ""folk"" did not have the connotation it does today. 

While I am going to mark this version of the article not approved so as not to add duplicates to the database, we do not have the two editorials which allude to the Final Solution. If you think they are related to this topic, can you please send them to me?

Highlights Poland as the main ""slaughterhouse"" as Germans systematically empty the ghettos they created. Points to Rabbi Stephen M. Wise as Jewish leader bringing attention to the German slaughter demonstrating Jewish activism in America. Lastly, it describes the killing of the Jews as taking place through exposure, starvation, and extreme working conditions to give Americans snapshot of life in the concentration camps.

Moreover, the Allies had specific indications that Poland was a ""slaughter house""  of Jews from ghettoes. This article challenges my assumption that the Allies were relatively oblivious of the specific atrocities of the Holocaust. I also wonder based on the reading of this article what the Allies did in their pledge that those responsible ""shall not escape retribution."" If the Allies were slow to act, that would be an uncomfortable realization for me.
